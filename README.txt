# 👨‍🏫 CODE FLOW – Java Code Visualizer for Beginners

**CODE FLOW** is an Android educational app that helps users understand how Java code is executed — one step at a time.

It provides an intuitive, interactive way to follow the logic of a program, highlighting each executed line and explaining the code in plain language. 
Designed primarily for beginners, the app bridges the gap between writing code and understanding how it runs under the hood.
